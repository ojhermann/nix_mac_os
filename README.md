# nix_mac_os

## v0

- trying out [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin) via [Determinate Nix](https://determinate.systems/nix/)
- my goal: get it working on a local machine and trying working with it for a while
- if all goes well, invest more time in learning [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and `nix-darwin`

### install Nix

- I used the [suggested installer](https://docs.determinate.systems/) from Determinate Systems
- I then made the [recommended changes](https://docs.determinate.systems/guides/nix-darwin/) to allow me to use `Determinate Nix` with `nix-darwin`
